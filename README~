**EMC 2 Arduino**

EMC 2 Arduino is a small collection of files intended to allow a person with
an Arduino Mega2560 (or UNO), an old USB enabled computer and a free copy of
LinuxCNC to begin building their very own CNC machine cheaply and quickly with
a variety of components, ranging from low-end inexpensive (even salvaged)
components such as old steppers and computer parts to high-end linear servos.

*Details*
The current version (these files) is 0.07b. It and previous versions can be found in the Downloads folder, zipped for your convenience. 

Instructions.txt has a good amount of documentation.

EMC 2 Arduino is known to work with ATMega2560 based Arduinos. 
32u4 based Arduinos (Leonardo, etc.) can also work, but some communication issues are still being ironed out.
